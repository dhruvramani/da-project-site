            <p class="mb-3">The broad goal of this project is to find the relationship between different factors that can potentially affect the currency exchange rate between different countries. For our project we have decided to base this study on the exchange rate of USD$ to Japanese Yen. </p>

                <li class="mb-3">Economic factors such as Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation are very highly correlated with exchange rate.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">Simple predictive models work well to predict exchange rate but can be improved by using domain knowledge.</li>
                <li class="mb-3">The USD-YEN exhcnage was the most stable during 1986-1992, i.e. the least volatile.</li>

            <hr class='mt-8 pb-20'>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-3">What are you trying to do?</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">The currency exchange rate has always dominated international trade and growth of a country. Both the prediction and description of exchange rate yields important information regarding a country’s growth. For this project, we are trying to understand the different factors that are responsible for affecting the exchange rate of currencies. For predictive analysis, the data being in a time-series format we can use different Machine learning methods for analysis and prediction.</p>

            <p class="mb-3">We are specifically focused on the change in currency rate of the Japanese Yen wrt to the US dollar exchange rate. Our reasoning behind this is that the US dollar is the world’s primary reserve currency and any changes to the US currency can have an adverse effect on other currencies. Contributing factors to the change in currency rate are economic factors in the US and Japan and stock market influence from the US. These factors can have a global impact on international trade and finance.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-3">Why are you trying to do this?</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">One assumption that is often made is that historical data should be able to incorporate the different factors affecting the exchange rate. Many researchers have constructed models using such historical data and it is an active area of research. We want to find what factors influence the currency rate based on various different analyses that are performed in the project.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-red-400 mb-3">Who might gain or be affected by doing it?</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">Currency rate can have various implications and can affect or help different stakeholder groups. Below are some people who might be affected.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-3">
                <li class="mb-2">Investors/Traders: By analyzing historical trends and patterns with good domain knowledge, this group can potentially predict and react to currency fluctuations and probably make profit out of it. But at the same time, without good knowledge this is a very risky area and can lead to a potential loss for people.</li>

                <li class="mb-2">Exporters and Importers: Those involved in international trade could be significantly affected by the market fluctuations. Generally, if the current market rate is low, exporters may benefit from it by being able to make cheaper goods but conversely importers may face increased costs.</li>

                <li class="mb-2">Central banks/Reserves and Government: Central banks and governments often monitor and analyze currency movements to formulate monetary and fiscal policies. Currency stability is crucial for economic health, and interventions may be considered in response to extreme fluctuations.</li>

                <li class="mb-2">Banks and Financial Institutions: Financial institutions providing currency exchange services can benefit from increased trading volumes during periods of currency volatility.</li>

                <li class="mb-2">Multinational Corporations: Companies with a global presence may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rate which can affect their profit margins, as revenues and costs are denominated in different currencies in different countries.</li>

                <li>Consumers: Consumers may experience changes in the cost of living, especially if their country relies heavily on imports.</li>
            </ul>
